# Monolithic LED Chip to Emit Multiple Colors

A light emitting diode chip with red, green and blue light emission regions on a single substrate. The light emission regions may be powered selectively to only emit one color light at a time. Or all three regions may be powered simultaneously so that the LED chip emits white light.

## Technical Details

This invention relates to a monolithic LED chip with multiple emission regions that can produce different colors. The regions are arranged on a single substrate and can be individually controlled to emit specific colors or work together to produce white light.

## Patent Number

Patent 7,271,420
