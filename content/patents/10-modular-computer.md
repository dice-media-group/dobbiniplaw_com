# Modular Computer System

One embodiment of the present invention relates to a modular computer system for use in residential, recreational, and commercial regions.

## Technical Details

The system is a computer system disposed within an existing outlet receptacle housing. The receptacle includes a conventional NEMA standard OS1 and OS2 type electrical housing and electrical line designed to accommodate a residential or commercial light switch, electrical outlet, etc. This innovative approach allows computing capabilities to be seamlessly integrated into existing structures without extensive remodeling or dedicated space requirements. The modular design permits customization based on specific needs and can be networked with other units to create distributed computing environments.
