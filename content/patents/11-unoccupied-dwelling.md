# Security System for Unoccupied Dwellings

This invention provides an integrated security solution specifically designed for dwellings that remain unoccupied for extended periods.

## Technical Details

The security system combines multiple detection technologies to monitor for unauthorized access, environmental hazards, and structural issues in unoccupied dwellings. It features wireless sensors that detect motion, glass breakage, door/window openings, water leaks, smoke, carbon monoxide, and temperature fluctuations. The system operates on a low-power platform with backup power to ensure continuous protection during outages. Remote monitoring capabilities allow property owners to receive real-time alerts and access surveillance footage via mobile devices. The design incorporates tamper-resistant components and cellular communication to maintain functionality even if traditional utilities are compromised.
