# Digital Support for AR Family Receivers

A digit support for AR family receivers designed to reside in a gap left between a receiver's pistol grip and trigger guard.

## Technical Details

A digit support for AR family receivers designed to reside in a gap left between a receiver’s pistol grip and trigger guard. The support fills the gap and ideally separates a user’s digit from the gap, thereby protecting the user’s digit from injury due to prolonged contact with the walls forming said gap. The digit support is easily installed without removal of any components of or attachments to the receiver and in its best mode allows for the simultaneous opening of the receiver’s trigger guard. In the best mode, the support is a body molded from a rubber compound having dimensions to fit snugly in the gap left between the trigger guard and the pistol grip. Ideally, the remaining exposed surface extends slightly higher than the depth of the gap and is cylindrically domed. Also in the best mode, the side of the body abutting the trigger guard mount should have a concavity designed to fit around the trigger guard mount so as to encompass said mount.
