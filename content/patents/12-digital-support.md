# Digital Support for AR Family Receivers

A digit support for AR family receivers designed to reside in a gap left between a receiver's pistol grip and trigger guard.

## Technical Details

This invention addresses an ergonomic issue in the AR platform by providing a specialized support for the shooter's finger when not engaged with the trigger. The support is contoured to fit precisely in the space between the pistol grip and trigger guard of AR-style firearms. It provides a comfortable resting position that improves hand positioning and reduces fatigue during extended use. The design enhances overall control while maintaining quick access to the trigger when needed. Constructed of durable materials compatible with the firearm's existing finish, the support can be installed without special tools or permanent modifications to the weapon.
