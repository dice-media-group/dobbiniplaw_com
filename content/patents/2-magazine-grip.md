# Magazine Grip

A magazine grip attachment for ammunition magazines to aid in extraction of magazines from ammunition pouches comprising a sleeve of resilient material molded in the general shape of a magazine yet with a smaller inner circumference than the circumference of a magazine so as to require the band to stretch over the magazine.

## Technical Details

The top of the band has an even slightly smaller inner circumference than the lower part of the band. Extending from the top of the band is a handle designed to allow a finger to wrap around the handle and extract the magazine. Also provided are recessed areas and four diagonal force distribution beams to constrict the invention and allow it to grip a magazine more snugly when the handle is pulled. The invention is also used in combination with a magazine pouch to deaden noise by biasing the magazines against the pouch and each other.
