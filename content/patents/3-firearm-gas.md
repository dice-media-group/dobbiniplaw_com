# Firearm Gas System

The present invention is a gas system for a firearm comprising a hollow gas tube extending between a forward gas tap in a firearm's barrel and a rearward piston assembly to impinge upon and operate the firearm's bolt operating system.

## Technical Details

The system does not have a translation rod extending between the two components as in prior art systems nor does it have a rearward tap like others. As such, it balances cleanliness and weight reduction of the prior art systems and reduces moving parts.
