# Spring-Loaded Firearm Safety Indicator

The invention is a firearm safety indicator that is spring-loaded, thus enabling self-ejection when a firearm's bolt is actuated.

## Technical Details

To attain this, the indicator comprises a main body and cantilever spring body joined together. A peg extends perpendicularly from the main body. In use, the peg is positioned inside the firing chamber of a firearm through the ejection port. The main body covers the ejection port, and the cantilever spring body is therefore compressed to attain proper positioning. The rifle's bolt is then used to engage and hold the peg in place. When actuated, the bolt releases the peg and the spring body is released, thrusting the indicator away from the firearm. Alternately, a metal spring may be utilized in the place of the cantilever spring body.
