# Grip Fractioning Pattern

The present invention discloses a grip fractioning pattern for any object, but specifically designed for handgun and rifle grips.

## Technical Details

The pattern consists of a series of spaces frusto-conical projections regularly spaced about the surface of the weapon's grip. Alternatively, the series may be interrupted by an interspaced series of pyramids, with their points not extending above the height of the frusto-conical projections. The grip pattern may be utilized in any circumstance where a user desires greater and more comfortable friction when gripping an object. This innovative design enhances control while reducing hand fatigue during extended use.
