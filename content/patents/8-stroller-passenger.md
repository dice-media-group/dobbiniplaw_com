# Stroller Passenger Support System

This invention provides an improved support system for stroller passengers, addressing limitations in conventional stroller designs.

## Technical Details

The stroller passenger support system features an adjustable framework that adapts to accommodate children of different sizes and ages. The system includes cushioned support elements that distribute weight evenly to prevent pressure points and enhance comfort during extended use. Safety features include improved restraints that secure the child while allowing natural movement and a breathable design that improves air circulation to prevent overheating. The materials used are durable, washable, and resistant to wear while remaining lightweight to minimize added bulk to the stroller.
