The device includes a microphone \nconfigured to detect a voice input, and a transmitter communicatively \ncoupled to a server and configured to transmit the voice input to the \nserver. The server is to generate vectors associated with the voice \ninput, feed the vectors associated with the voice input to an Artificial\n Intelligence utilizing a trained Machine Learning (ML) model, and \nobtain, from the trained ML model, an output corresponding to the \nvectors. The device further includes a receiver communicatively coupled \nto the server, and configured to receive from the server, the output \ngenerated by the ML model. A speaker is communicatively coupled with the\n receiver and is configured to generate a voice-based response based on \nthe output, for assisting the respondent in responding to the \nconversation.",
