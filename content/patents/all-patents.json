The device includes a microphone \nconfigured to detect a voice input, and a transmitter communicatively \ncoupled to a server and configured to transmit the voice input to the \nserver. The server is to generate vectors associated with the voice \ninput, feed the vectors associated with the voice input to an Artificial\n Intelligence utilizing a trained Machine Learning (ML) model, and \nobtain, from the trained ML model, an output corresponding to the \nvectors. The device further includes a receiver communicatively coupled \nto the server, and configured to receive from the server, the output \ngenerated by the ML model. A speaker is communicatively coupled with the\n receiver and is configured to generate a voice-based response based on \nthe output, for assisting the respondent in responding to the \nconversation.",

      "abstract": "A\n method of teaching keyboard instruments involves placing semi-permanent\n plates on specific keys of the keyboard, providing tactile stimulation \nwhich will develop muscle memory and confidence in playing correct \nnotes. Different textures and colors may be employed to help \ndifferentiate plates and associated keys from others. Placement of \nplates on keys is to be determined by the instructor in consideration of\n the student's needs. Placement may be made on one or multiple keys, \nwhich may include an entire middle octave. Texturing may be a subtle as \nBraille characters or more bold designs and individual shapes of the \nplates may be flat or may be shaped to facilitate hand posture. Colors \nmay be associated with specific notes on the grand staff to provide a \nvisual aid. Finger adornments may also be used to aid in color \ncorrespondence. Plates may be held onto piano keys by utilizing either \nwet or dry adhesives.",

      "abstract": "A skate blade bending apparatus (35) may feature a unitary body (1) with a securement structure (10, 15) which holds a skate blade on its side, parallel to the ground, and a means for exerting downward force (8) on the side of the skate blade. The securement structure may feature movable anvils 15 which will change the imparted radius of curvature imparted upon the blade. Indicia (29) may be utilized to position said anvils (15) to ensure the process is repeatable on different blades. A handle (14) used with the means for exerting downward force (8) may be adjustable. The means for exerting downward force (8) and anvils (15) may be interchangeable with other shapes of similar structures for greater versatility.",

Should an integral condition not be \nconstantly met while the moving average conditions are being determined,\n the yaw integral counter resets and the whole process must begin again.\n This method balances most unintentional activation conditions with \nactivation latency.

      "abstract": "A sensor to measure \ndielectric constant of a medium may have a transmission line acting as a\n probe, and electronic circuit, and cable filter providing to reduce \nsensitivity of the sensor to cable parameters and influences. The sensor\n circuit may use a periodic signal generator to produce a carrier wave, \nwhich stimulates the transmission line, through a complex network \ncoupling element. The complex impedance network forms a voltage divider \nwith the transmission line, wherein the output of the voltage divider \nmay be demodulated with an AM demodulator, such as a thermally \ncompensated peak detector. This demodulated signal would be related to \nthe characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and thus to the \ndielectric constant of the material surrounding the partially inserted \ntransmission line probe. The demodulated signal may be offset, scaled, \nand linearized with a microcontroller containing signal processing \nroutines, linearizing equations, stored calibration constants and look \nup tables.",

The louver provides at \nleast one directional passages which control the flow of propulsion \ngases after firing the revolver. Numerous embodiments are disclosed \nincluding some having an expansion capability to further block gas \npassage and one embodiment which is an extension of the revolver frame \nitself. One embodiment further comprises an expansion groove to further \nblock the passage of propulsion gases. As such, the present invention's \ngeneral purpose is to provide a new and improved revolver that is more \ncompact and safer for the user than a conventional revolver.",

Numerous designs for the ratchet pads and \nthe ratchet arm are disclosed, as is a stepped drawbar to accommodate \nthe workings of the firearm and a locking bar that interfaces with both \nthe hammer and locking notches in the circumference of the cylinder so \nas to release and secure the cylinder in appropriate positions.",

      "abstract": "The \npresent invention is a modular support for vine plants and tomato \nplants. It comprises a solid, cylindrical base with holes to accept \nposts and associate tier rings. A cover may also be provided to \ntransform the base into a miniature hot house. Notches may be formed in \nthe rim of the base to accommodate irrigation systems and stake ends may\n be provided for the posts to allow immediate securement of the posts to\n the ground rather than the base. The solid base contains water, mulch \nand other beneficial compounds for the plants and helps block the spread\n of weeds immediately around the plant. As the plant grows, additional \ntiers may be added to the support to increase its size. The parts are \npreferably made of a durable plastic so as to support larger plants and \nincrease longevity of the support.",

      "abstract": "The \npresent invention is a spring-biased folding firearm that stows \ncompactly and safely. The firearm has three main components: a stock, a \nreceiver and a grip/magazine combination. In folding, the stock folds \nover the receiver, sandwiching the grip/magazine between the components.\n When folded, the magazine over-inserts into the grip housing, allowing \nthe stock to clear and providing additional safety when stowed by \nisolating the ammunition feed. A buttplate latches over the open joint \nto contain the unit and further secure it. When stowed, the bolt is \ndisengaged from the ammunition feed supply, preventing accidental \nfiring, so a loaded round can be safely carried in the chamber—allowing \nfor immediate use of the firearm upon opening. The weapon is deployed \nthrough single-handed actuation and is spring-assisted into firing \nposition. Currently the firearm uses readily available aftermarket parts\n for easier replacement if necessary and does contain hardware for \nmounting accessories.",

Since the heat \nchamber supplies the major component to the junction temperature, \ndwarfing the other components, it is a reasonable proxy for true \njunction temperature. The data is compiled to determine change of peak \nwavelength as a function of temperature and that function can then be \nused to determine junction temperature of similar LEDs that are \ninstalled in a system or manufactured. The invention may also be used to\n measure other useful data, such as power, output power changing with \nthe junction temperature and intensity of the LED over time and may be \nused to estimate failure rate.",
