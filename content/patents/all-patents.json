The device includes a microphone \nconfigured to detect a voice input, and a transmitter communicatively \ncoupled to a server and configured to transmit the voice input to the \nserver. The server is to generate vectors associated with the voice \ninput, feed the vectors associated with the voice input to an Artificial\n Intelligence utilizing a trained Machine Learning (ML) model, and \nobtain, from the trained ML model, an output corresponding to the \nvectors. The device further includes a receiver communicatively coupled \nto the server, and configured to receive from the server, the output \ngenerated by the ML model. A speaker is communicatively coupled with the\n receiver and is configured to generate a voice-based response based on \nthe output, for assisting the respondent in responding to the \nconversation.",

Utilizing power measurements within one or \nmore harmonics, the tip-sample distance in the tunneling junction may be\n regulated for maximum efficiency and avoid tip crash when used with \nresistive samples.

Accelerometers measure forces \nexerted upon an object to determine orientation in pitch, roll, and yaw \naxes, and to determine motion of the object. When threshold conditions \nfor these orientations and movements are measured, the method combines \ntaking moving averages of pitch, roll, and yaw, and additionally \naccumulating an integral of yaw to determine if an activation or \ndeactivation condition is met. Should an integral condition not be \nconstantly met while the moving average conditions are being determined,\n the yaw integral counter resets and the whole process must begin again.\n This method balances most unintentional activation conditions with \nactivation latency. Another methodology tracks the motion of a wrist \nflick, similar to casting a fishing line, using acceleration and \ndeceleration parameters.",

The method involves placing two \ndiodes of opposite directions in parallel and applying a DC bias such \nthat a forward diode may then handle higher than normal voltages and a \nreverse diode provides a failsafe in the event of a reverse bias.",

      "abstract": "A\n microwave frequency comb (MFC) is produced when a mode-locked ultrafast\n laser is focused on the tunneling junction of a scanning tunneling \nmicroscope (STM). The MFC consists of hundreds of measureable harmonics \nat integer multiples of the pulse repetition frequency of the laser, \nwhich are superimposed on the DC tunneling current. In Scanning \nFrequency Comb Microscopy (SFCM) the tip and/or sample electrode of the \nSTM is moved vertically and laterally so that the power in the MFC may \nbe measured at one or more locations on the surface of the sample and, \nfrom the power, carrier density, and other characteristics, of the \nsample may be calculated. SFCM is non-destructive of the sample. While \nmany systems are possible to practice SFCM, a preferred apparatus is \ndisclosed.",

The communicative link may be wireless. Frequency \nswitching or encoding may be used to pair sets of controllers for a \ngiven aisle to the exclusion of others. Override switches are also \nprovided as are power output for the lighting hardware and other \nancillary hardware. The invention may also be adapted to merchandizing \ngondolas and end caps.",

Additional structures to direct \nflow of expelled air are also provided. The collar arm may be removable \nfrom the collar. The motor has many applications where oscillatory \nmotion is required, such as in tattoo needles.",

The follower and magazine \ncasing are also designed to interface to prevent the follower from \npopping out of the feed end and the floor plate of the magazine utilizes\n a locking plate and sliding relationship between the floor plate, \nlocking plate and magazine to secure the floor plate onto the magazine \ncasing. The cover features built in tools for, among other things, \nunloading and disassembling the magazine.",

      "abstract": "The \npresent invention is a spring-biased folding firearm that stows \ncompactly and safely. The firearm has three main components: a stock, a \nreceiver and a grip/magazine combination. In folding, the stock folds \nover the receiver, sandwiching the grip/magazine between the components.\n When folded, the magazine over-inserts into the grip housing, allowing \nthe stock to clear and providing additional safety when stowed by \nisolating the ammunition feed. A buttplate latches over the open joint \nto contain the unit and further secure it. When stowed, the bolt is \ndisengaged from the ammunition feed supply, preventing accidental \nfiring, so a loaded round can be safely carried in the chamber—allowing \nfor immediate use of the firearm upon opening. The weapon is deployed \nthrough single-handed actuation and is spring-assisted into firing \nposition. Currently the firearm uses readily available aftermarket parts\n for easier replacement if necessary and does contain hardware for \nmounting accessories.",

First a sample LED is placed in a heat chamber and\n the change of the LED's peak wavelength is recorded over time, as is \nthe change in the temperature in the heat chamber. Since the heat \nchamber supplies the major component to the junction temperature, \ndwarfing the other components, it is a reasonable proxy for true \njunction temperature. The data is compiled to determine change of peak \nwavelength as a function of temperature and that function can then be \nused to determine junction temperature of similar LEDs that are \ninstalled in a system or manufactured. The invention may also be used to\n measure other useful data, such as power, output power changing with \nthe junction temperature and intensity of the LED over time and may be \nused to estimate failure rate.",

The system electrically couples the device to an \nexisting power system while providing a mechanical coupling for support.\n In addition, the system provides for vertical adjustments while \nmaintaining the electrical and mechanical coupling. The system generally\n includes a recess coupling module, a vertical support receptacle, an \nelectrical power system, and at least one electrical device. The \nvertical support receptacle is coupled to the recess coupling module in a\n substantially perpendicular manner. The electrical power system is \nelectrically coupled to the electrical system disposed in the existing \npower recess and distributed across the vertical support receptacle. The\n at least one electrical device is adjustably coupled to the vertical \nsupport receptacle such that it is both mechanically supported and \nelectrically powered.",

As a further \nmethod, the probe may rotate about an area of interest and the data then\n may be subjected to a Fourier analysis for further refined results. \nMultiple coils may be used in the probe, each with a different coil \nfunction which could include one uniform coil.
