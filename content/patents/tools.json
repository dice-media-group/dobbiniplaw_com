The ladder rack is \nmountable upon a surface, such as a vehicle roof, and contains a portion\n of a ladder within it. The ladder is secured transversely within the \npocket as the opening is smaller than the width of a ladder rail and the\n use of two ladder racks, since one arm projects around a ladder rail, \nwill secure against translational movement along the car's length if \npositioned to abut ladder rungs. An optional S-bend can be utilized to \nfurther control of the ladder in stowage and in securing against \nmovement in transit.",

The ladder rack is \nmountable upon a surface, such as a vehicle roof, and contains a portion\n of a ladder within it. The ladder is secured transversely within the \npocket as the opening is smaller than the width of a ladder rail and the\n use of two ladder racks, since one arm projects around a ladder rail, \nwill secure against translational movement along the car's length if \npositioned to abut ladder rungs. An optional S-bend can be utilized to \nfurther control of the ladder in stowage and in securing against \nmovement in transit.",
