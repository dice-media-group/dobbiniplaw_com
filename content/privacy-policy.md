## Privacy Policy

Dobbin IP Law P.C. ("Dobbin IP Law") operates dobbiniplaw.com and may operate other websites. It is Dobbin IP Law's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Dobbin IP Law collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Dobbin IP Law's purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how Dobbin IP Law's visitors use its website. From time to time, Dobbin IP Law may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Dobbin IP Law also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on dobbiniplaw.com blogs/sites. Dobbin IP Law only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Dobbin IP Law's websites choose to interact with Dobbin IP Law in ways that require Dobbin IP Law to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Dobbin IP Law gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at dobbiniplaw.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Dobbin IP Law are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Dobbin IP Law collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Dobbin IP Law. Dobbin IP Law does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
