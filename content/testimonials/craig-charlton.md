I have been working with Geoff Dobbin for approximately 8 years in relation to a range of patent, trademark and product licensing matters. I have found Geoff to be a knowledgeable and diligent intellectual property attorney who is also a pleasure to deal with.

Geoff was able to provide practical and timely responses to questions I asked and was instrumental in finalizing patents and a trademark for my invention. I would not hesitate in recommending Geoff.
