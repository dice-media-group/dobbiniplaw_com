I am Lee Von Gunten, CEO of Watchdog manufacturing, where we produce and sell Home Security products such as our Watchdog Timers and others. I am pleased and proud to offer this short but sweet testimonial regarding Geoff Dobbin and his team at Dobbin IP Law P.C. This is a voluntary testimonial for Geoff and his company. Geoff did not ask for it.

We've been working with Geoff and staff for over 12 years with total confidence in the professionality and completeness of their services at fair costs through all of our patent and trademark work. Geoff has been there for us to help and answer questions and to advise us in all matters of Intellectual Law through several patent applications and trademark listings.

Geoff and his staff are tops. I can't recommend them too highly.
