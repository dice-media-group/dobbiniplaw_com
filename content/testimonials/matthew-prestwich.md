I've known Geoff Dobbin and have used him as my patent attorney for over 7 years. During that time Geoff has filed multiple patents for me. Before meeting Geoff I consulted other patent attorneys and always came away frustrated that I could not get definite answers to my questions. It was refreshing when on my very first meeting with Geoff he gave me straight answers, explaining even the most complicated Intellectual Property issues in easy to understand language.

Geoff has demonstrated utmost integrity while working on my patents and has an extensive knowledge of all aspects of Intellectual Property law. His work is of the highest quality and is delivered in a timely manner. I'm pleased to give Geoff my highest recommendation for your Intellectual Property work.
