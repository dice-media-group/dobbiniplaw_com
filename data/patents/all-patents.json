      "abstract": "A\n method of teaching keyboard instruments involves placing semi-permanent\n plates on specific keys of the keyboard, providing tactile stimulation \nwhich will develop muscle memory and confidence in playing correct \nnotes. Different textures and colors may be employed to help \ndifferentiate plates and associated keys from others. Placement of \nplates on keys is to be determined by the instructor in consideration of\n the student's needs. Placement may be made on one or multiple keys, \nwhich may include an entire middle octave. Texturing may be a subtle as \nBraille characters or more bold designs and individual shapes of the \nplates may be flat or may be shaped to facilitate hand posture. Colors \nmay be associated with specific notes on the grand staff to provide a \nvisual aid. Finger adornments may also be used to aid in color \ncorrespondence. Plates may be held onto piano keys by utilizing either \nwet or dry adhesives.",

Blending of the active is accomplished by \nmixing the Poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) with an active ingredient, such as a\n peroxide like hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide, sodium perborate, \nor sodium percarbonate, usually also with water or an appropriate \norganic solvent. Peroxide concentrations in these new gels can reach a \n30% concentration of hydrogen peroxide while maintaining a shelf life of\n six months at room temperature without developing peroxide \ndecomposition. The gels are applied to an appropriate backing and dried \nto a gelatinous state. In use, the active is hydrated and regains \nadhesiveness. Then the tray is pressed and formed around a user's dental\n arch to form the customizable tray. Multiple active ingredients may be \nused, with or without peroxide, for accomplishing desired treatment \nregimens.",

Accelerometers measure forces \nexerted upon an object to determine orientation in pitch, roll, and yaw \naxes, and to determine motion of the object. When threshold conditions \nfor these orientations and movements are measured, the method combines \ntaking moving averages of pitch, roll, and yaw, and additionally \naccumulating an integral of yaw to determine if an activation or \ndeactivation condition is met. Should an integral condition not be \nconstantly met while the moving average conditions are being determined,\n the yaw integral counter resets and the whole process must begin again.\n This method balances most unintentional activation conditions with \nactivation latency. Another methodology tracks the motion of a wrist \nflick, similar to casting a fishing line, using acceleration and \ndeceleration parameters.",

A wrap made up of composite fiber \nis wrapped onto a steel riffled barrel liner in a continuous fashion, \nwith no interruption within the steel liner for the purpose of \ndelivering high pressure gas through the steel liner. After joining the \ncomposite wrap to the steel barrel liner, either by mechanical or \nchemical procedure, a slot is formed by carving out a top and/or a \nbottom of the composite. A gas key insert is then placed in the made \nslots and retained by mechanical or chemical procedure. Finally, a gas \nport is drilled through the key insert.",

The control switch may then be\n activated though the casing without breaching the same so that a more \nsterile unit may be presented in those situations requiring sterility. \nThe tool light also may have an adhesive, so it may be temporarily \npositioned according to a user's liking on a given tool. Emphasis is \ngiven to medical devices where a small field of vision and little room \nfor movement may be prohibitive of desired lighting placement, but the \nlight may be used on any suitable tool in any suitable medical or \nnon-medical situation.",

The \ncomplex impedance network forms a voltage divider with the transmission \nline, wherein the output of the voltage divider, is demodulated with an \nAM demodulator, such as a thermally compensated peak detector. This \ndemodulated signal is related to the dielectric constant, and thus the \nliquid level of the material surrounding the partially submerged \ntransmission line probe. The liquid level and the demodulated signal may\n be offset, scaled and linearized with a microcontroller containing \nsignal processing routines, linearizing equations, stored calibration \nconstants and look up tables.",

In Scanning \nFrequency Comb Microscopy (SFCM) the tip and/or sample electrode of the \nSTM is moved vertically and laterally so that the power in the MFC may \nbe measured at one or more locations on the surface of the sample and, \nfrom the power, carrier density, and other characteristics, of the \nsample may be calculated.

The firearm has three main components: a stock, a \nreceiver and a grip/magazine combination. In folding, the stock folds \nover the receiver, sandwiching the grip/magazine between the components.\n When folded, the magazine over-inserts into the grip housing, allowing \nthe stock to clear and providing additional safety when stowed by \nisolating the ammunition feed. A buttplate latches over the open joint \nto contain the unit and further secure it. When stowed, the bolt is \ndisengaged from the ammunition feed supply, preventing accidental \nfiring, so a loaded round can be safely carried in the chamber—allowing \nfor immediate use of the firearm upon opening. The weapon is deployed \nthrough single-handed actuation and is spring-assisted into firing \nposition. Currently the firearm uses readily available aftermarket parts\n for easier replacement if necessary and does contain hardware for \nmounting accessories.",

The cable \nmanagement device includes first and second expanded regions, a medial \nregion, and at least one channel with a resealable slit. The first and \nsecond expanded regions are respectively wider than the medial region. \nThe at least one channel includes an opening on the first region, an \nopening on the medial region, and an internal cavity therebetween. The \ninternal cavity may be intentionally exposed via a resealable slit to \nallow a cable to be routed through the internal cavity between the \nopenings. Upon release, slit automatically reseals, thereby reliably \nsupporting the cable. A second embodiment includes two such channels, \none in each expanded region. An improved embodiment features transition \nzones at the origin and terminus of each channel, a rounded edge to each\n slit, and transitioning curvature of the medial region.",

First a sample LED is placed in a heat chamber and\n the change of the LED's peak wavelength is recorded over time, as is \nthe change in the temperature in the heat chamber. Since the heat \nchamber supplies the major component to the junction temperature, \ndwarfing the other components, it is a reasonable proxy for true \njunction temperature. The data is compiled to determine change of peak \nwavelength as a function of temperature and that function can then be \nused to determine junction temperature of similar LEDs that are \ninstalled in a system or manufactured. The invention may also be used to\n measure other useful data, such as power, output power changing with \nthe junction temperature and intensity of the LED over time and may be \nused to estimate failure rate.",

The method utilizes mathematical calculations on data \nobtained by a probe with non-uniformly wound detection coil. While \nnon-uniform, the coil winding is specific according to a known and \ndetermined function, such as a sinusoidal variation. As a further \nmethod, the probe may rotate about an area of interest and the data then\n may be subjected to a Fourier analysis for further refined results. \nMultiple coils may be used in the probe, each with a different coil \nfunction which could include one uniform coil. Also disclosed is a \nmethod for making the coils necessary in the practice of the method.",

The major components are an actuator to provide charging\n function and upon which other components are mounted, a spring biased \nlever with a hook which biases downward so that the hook may interface a\n bolt carrier when the lever is activated, and a blade upon which handle\n structure is mounted. In the preferred embodiment, the handle is \nambidextrous and features a spring detent to keep it in stowed position \nuntil the user desires use. The handle will only reciprocate when the \nlever is activated, which in turn requires intentional user action, \nthereby providing a relatively safer weapon to operate.",

To attain this, the \nindicator comprises a main body and cantilever spring body joined \ntogether. A peg extends perpendicularly from the main body. In use, the \npeg is positioned inside the firing chamber of a firearm through the \nejection port. The main body covers the ejection port and the cantilever\n spring body is therefore compressed to attain proper positioning. The \nrifle's bolt is then used to engage and hold the peg in place. When \nactuated, the bolt releases the peg and the spring body is released, \nthrusting the indicator away from the firearm. Alternately, a metal \nspring may be utilized in the place of the cantilever spring body.",

The system \nreplaces the rifle's buffer tube with a modified one containing a mount \nfor a constant cheek weld and a rail track for adjustment. A stock \nmodule then mounts on the replacement buffer tube. The stock module is \ninterchangeable depending on the user's needs. Various configurations of\n the stock module are discussed, including adjustable stocks, fixed \nstocks, and specialized stocks. The stock module may be made even \nfurther modular by the addition of rail system.",

      "abstract": "A digit support for AR\n family receivers designed to reside in a gap left between a receiver's \npistol grip and trigger guard. The support fills the gap and ideally \nseparates a user's digit from the gap, thereby protecting the user's \ndigit from injury due to prolonged contact with the walls forming said \ngap. The digit support is easily installed without removal of any \ncomponents of or attachments to the receiver and in its best mode allows\n for the simultaneous opening of the receiver's trigger guard. In the \nbest mode, the support is a body molded from a rubber compound having \ndimensions to fit snugly in the gap left between the trigger guard and \nthe pistol grip. Ideally, the remaining exposed surface extends slightly\n higher than the depth of the gap and is cylindrically domed. Also in \nthe best mode, the side of the body abutting the trigger guard mount \nshould have a concavity designed to fit around the trigger guard mount \nso as to encompass said mount.",
