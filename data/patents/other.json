A piston (220), driven by at least one actuator (214a-c), \nmay be attached to one of the films (204) to displace it with respect to\n the remainder of the assembly. Such action of the piston (220) distorts\n both films (202), (204) to change the shape of the lens and may be \ndriven by bimorph actuators (214a-c). Distance of displacement may be \ncalculated by measuring a magnetic field created by at least one magnet \n(222a-c) attached to the piston (220). Feedback control may be used to \nstabilize the apparatus.",

A piezo actuator and stepper motor advances an\n STM tip towards a sample at a given distance until measuring a current \ngreater than or equal to a desired setpoint current. Readings of the \ncontemporaneous step are analyzed to direct the system to change \ncontinue or change direction and also determine the size of each step. \nIn simulations where Proportion and/or Integral control methodology was \nadded to the algorithm the stability of the feedback control is \ndecreased. The present methodology accounts for temperature variances in\n the environment and also appears to clean and protect the tip \nelectrode, prolonging its useful life.",

Readings of the \ncontemporaneous step are analyzed to direct the system to change \ncontinue or change direction and also determine the size of each step. \nIn simulations where Proportion and/or Integral control methodology was \nadded to the algorithm the stability of the feedback control is \ndecreased.
