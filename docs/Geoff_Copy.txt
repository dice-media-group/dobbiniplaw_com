Geoff Dobbin has assisted independent inventors and other creators of intellectual property with protecting their "babies" for almost 30 years.   He understands just how invested you can feel after all the hard work that went into your creation.
Although he founded Dobbin IP Law P.C. when he moved to Utah in 2004, Geoff has been practicing intellectual property law and representing creators in need of patents, copyrights and trademarks since 1998.  He has a degree in physics that gives him a solid scientific background to understand many different technical fields, so he is quick on the uptake and easily grasps new concepts and ideas, no matter how complex.
Geoff is a solo practitioner with a strong track record as evidenced by his prior work.  He especially enjoys working with independent inventors and watching businesses grow and expand.  He is an avid fan of Doctor Who, the Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Star Trek.  In his spare time, he enjoys smoking various kinds of foods, astrophotography, and volunteers at his local church.
