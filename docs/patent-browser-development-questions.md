# Thought-Provoking Questions: Patent Browser Feature

## Strategic Questions for Improving Development

1. **Data Scalability**: The plan accounts for 256 patents, but how would the architecture change if the firm's portfolio grows to thousands of patents over time? Should we implement pagination or virtual scrolling from the beginning?

2. **Patent Categories**: We've assumed categories based on technical fields, but what other organizing principles might benefit users? Would chronological organization, inventor grouping, or client-based categorization provide additional value?

3. **User Research**: Have we validated that the Netflix-style browsing pattern matches how potential clients actually want to explore the firm's expertise? What user insights might reshape our approach?

4. **Content Strategy**: Beyond patent drawings, what other visual elements could enhance the browsing experience? Would including client success stories or visualizations of patent impact create a more compelling narrative?

5. **Analytics Integration**: How can we instrument this feature to measure engagement and provide insights about which patents or categories generate the most interest? What metrics would indicate success?

6. **Accessibility Considerations**: Dark-themed interfaces create contrast challenges for some users. How might we ensure the interface remains accessible while maintaining the Netflix aesthetic?

7. **SEO Implications**: The current plan uses modals for patent details. Would creating dedicated pages for each patent with structured data markup provide better discoverability and authority in search results?

8. **Performance Budget**: What performance metrics should we establish for this feature, especially considering image-heavy content? How do we balance visual richness with load times?

9. **Progressive Enhancement**: If we create a sophisticated client-side experience, how do we ensure users with JavaScript disabled or search engines still access the content effectively?

10. **Competitive Differentiation**: How does this approach truly differentiate from other law firms' patent portfolios? What unique aspects of Dobbin IP's approach could be highlighted in the interface?

11. **Integration Points**: Beyond being a standalone feature, how might this patent browser integrate with other parts of the site, such as practice area pages or attorney profiles?

12. **Content Management**: Should we build an admin interface for managing the patent collection, or will this be a developer-maintained feature? What would a sustainable content update process look like?
