          <p class="mb-6 font-crimson">
            A copyright is a protectable interest granted to an author (or other artist) to protect his or her creative work. It keeps art work in the form of literature, sculpture, painting, drama, or music from being copied, distributed, performed, or displayed by another person or entity. Keep in mind, it protects from copying, not independent creation. It also does not protect ideas, but instead, the expression of those ideas in tangible or appreciable form. Other things it cannot protect include unrecorded improvisational performances, titles, slogans, and portions of works containing information considered common property or themes.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 font-crimson">Copyrights and Patents</h3>
          <p class="mb-6 font-crimson">
            Like patents, the ability to protect copyrights comes from Article 1, section 8 of our Constitution. However, a patent is a grant from the government, and requires a lengthy application process. A copyright is registered, like sticking your flag on a piece of land. Registration means the government recognizes your claim and is letting the world know it does.

          <p class="mb-6 font-crimson">
            Copyrights are designed to protect original works of authorship. A trademark is used to protect logos, as well as the names of businesses, products, and services. Both are registered rights â€“ basic copyright and trademark rights begin the moment of creation or use, and then are registered with the government to give notice to the world and secure additional rights and assumptions.

          <p class="mb-4 font-crimson">
            In most situations, only the owner of the copyright can reproduce a creative work and authorize others to do the same. However, there are some limitations. For example, fair use allows a work to be reproduced for reasons deemed "fair" in our free society such as criticism, reporting, teaching, and research. When determining whether or not something should be considered fair, the following factors are used:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-6 font-crimson">
            <li class="mb-2">The purpose and character of use, including whether or not it is used for a nonprofit or a commercial purpose,</li>
            <li class="mb-2">The nature of the copyright,</li>
            <li class="mb-2">The number of works reproduced in relation to the work as a whole, &</li>
            <li>The effect of the reproduced work's use as a market value of the work.</li>
