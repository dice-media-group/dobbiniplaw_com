          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">What are Copyrights?</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">
            Copyrights protect original works of authorship, including literary, artistic, musical, and certain other intellectual works. At Dobbin IP Law, we help creators protect their creative expressions through comprehensive copyright services.

          <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">The Value of Copyright Registration</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            While your work is automatically protected by copyright law the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form, registering your copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office provides crucial advantages:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Legal Standing:</strong> Registration establishes a public record of your copyright claim
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Enforcement Power:</strong> Registration is required before filing an infringement lawsuit
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Statutory Damages:</strong> Registered works may be eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Presumption of Validity:</strong> Registration creates a legal presumption of copyright validity
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customs Protection:</strong> Registration can be recorded with U.S. Customs to prevent importation of infringing copies
            </li>
          </ul>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Did You Know?</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">There are other limitations to copyrights including <strong class="text-dobbin-green">time shifting!</strong></p>
            <p>
              Copyright law is complex, with various exceptions and limitations such as fair use, time shifting, and first sale doctrine. Our attorneys can help you navigate these complexities to understand both the protections and limitations of copyright law.
