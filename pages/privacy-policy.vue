          <p>Dobbin IP Law P.C. ("Dobbin IP Law") operates dobbiniplaw.com and may operate other websites. It is Dobbin IP Law's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3 font-crimson font-semibold">Website Visitors</h3>
          <p>Like most website operators, Dobbin IP Law collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Dobbin IP Law's purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how Dobbin IP Law's visitors use its website. From time to time, Dobbin IP Law may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
          
          <p>Dobbin IP Law also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on dobbiniplaw.com blogs/sites. Dobbin IP Law only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3 font-crimson font-semibold">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Certain visitors to Dobbin IP Law's websites choose to interact with Dobbin IP Law in ways that require Dobbin IP Law to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Dobbin IP Law gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at dobbiniplaw.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Dobbin IP Law are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Dobbin IP Law collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Dobbin IP Law. Dobbin IP Law does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3 font-crimson font-semibold">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
          <p>Dobbin IP Law may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Dobbin IP Law may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Dobbin IP Law does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3 font-crimson font-semibold">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
          <p>Dobbin IP Law discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Dobbin IP Law's behalf or to provide services available at Dobbin IP Law's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Dobbin IP Law's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Dobbin IP Law will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Dobbin IP Law discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Dobbin IP Law believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Dobbin IP Law, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Dobbin IP Law website and have supplied your email address, Dobbin IP Law may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Dobbin IP Law and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Dobbin IP Law takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-6 mb-3 font-crimson font-semibold">Business Transfers</h3>
          <p>If Dobbin IP Law, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Dobbin IP Law goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Dobbin IP Law may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
